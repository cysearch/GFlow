# This script is a documented working example of Gflow with a handful of random pairwise computations (until convergence = 1N)
# using 4 cpus on Ubuntu where the current density summation is the only output. 

# Gflow must be compiled locally before executing this script. Dependencies for GFlow include: openmpi, hypre, and petsc.

# Execution flags are annotated below and demonstrate an example execution of GFlow. To execute script as is: type 'sh execute_example.sh'
# in Terminal.

which mpiexec

# Set and add PETSc to PATH (Please update this if you are using Linux or any installation proceedure that differs from the README)
export PETSC_DIR=/usr/lib/petscdir/3.7.3/x86_64-linux-gnu-real
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=${PETSC_DIR}/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH

# REQUIRED flags to execute GFlow are below. Please read descriptions or see example arguments for use.

	# Set Number of processes (CPUs) and call Gflow.x  - Currently -n = 4 below

	# -habitat
		# Set Habitat Map or resistance surface (.asc)
	# -nodes
		# Set Focal Nodes or Source/Destination Points (.txt list of point pairs OR .asc grid to calculate). Inputs must be points.
		# Node coordinates must be relative to the resistance surface grid. Please look at example inputs.


# OPTIONAL flags

	# -output_density_filename
		# Set Output Path, file name, and format (i.e., *.asc, *.asc.gz) of individual pairwise calculations. Omitting this
		# flag will discard each pairwise solve output and assume you want the cumulative output only. Currently omitted below. Do
		# not use spaces in the filepath.
		# For use see: https://github.com/gflow/GFlow/issues/8
	# -output_sum_density_filename
		# Set Output Path, file name prefix, and format (i.e., *.asc, *.asc.gz) of final summed calculation. If omitted, the final
		# summed current density will be discarded. Do not use spaces in the filepath.
		# For use see: https://github.com/Pbleonard/GFlow/issues/8
	# -node_pairs
		# Calculate only desired node pairs if input. Currently not used. Listed pairs should be referenced by their ID, not their
		# coordinates.
	# -max_distance
		# Only calculate pairs within a given euclidean distance. Units should correspond to input grids (typically meters)
	# -converge_at
		# Set Convergence Factor to stop calculating. Typically used in place of 'node_pairs' or if all pairwise is too
		# computationally time consuming. Acceptable formats include: '4N' or '.9999'. Set to '1N' Below. If omitted, gflow will
		# calculate all pairwise
	# -shuffle_node_pairs
		# Shuffles pairs for random selection. Input is binary. Currently set to shuffle below (= 1)
	# -effective_resistance
		# Print effective resistance to log file. Supply path for .csv


# Set Output Directory: Default is Current Directory
OUTPUT_DIR=/opt/output/

# # gflow will not automatically create the output directory.  Ensure the directory exists, otherwise the program will crash.
# [[ -d ${OUTPUT_DIR} ]] || mkdir -p ${OUTPUT_DIR}
