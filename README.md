Software for modeling circuit theory-based connectivity at any scale. We developed GFlow to solve large ecological problems in a High Performance Computing environment. If solving a small problem or if you are willing to sacrifice some performance, it can be deployed on a desktop computer running modern versions of Linux or Mac OS X.

## Installation

### [Please download latest release with sample data.](https://github.com/Pbleonard/GFlow/releases/latest)

### Mac OS X Install Instructions
The easiest way to setup your environment is with the
[Homebrew](http://brew.sh) package manager.
After Homebrew is set up, run the following commands to install
the required packages:

    brew update
    brew install openmpi
    brew install homebrew/science/hypre
    brew install homebrew/science/petsc
    brew install coreutils					# optional

**Note**: Advanced users may build their own versions of PETSc and an MPI library, `gflow` does not require
any specific preconditioner (we recommend `hypre`) nor does it depend on a particular
MPI implementation.

With the required packages installed, `gflow` can be built inside its containing folder by running the following terminal command there:

     make

If you encounter errors related to PETSc, you may have to edit the `Makefile` to change the 
value of the `PETSC_DIR` variable. For example, during the above proceedure, homebrew installed petsc here:

	/usr/local/Cellar/petsc/3.7.3/real

Currently, there is no mechanism to automatically copy the `gflow.x` binary to a centrally-located
directory.


### Linux Install Instructions
While users are free to build GFlow dependcies themselves, we find a package manager is suitable for many users and the easiest way to get started. For example on Ubuntu based systems you can use the default package management tool called [apt](https://help.ubuntu.com/lts/serverguide/apt.html) or optionally install and use [Aptitude](https://help.ubuntu.com/lts/serverguide/aptitude.html) 


To Install Aptitude, run the following command in terminal:
	
	sudo apt-get install aptitude

Then the dependices using aptitude (you may need to be root e.g., use `sudo` prefix as above):

	aptitude install openmpi-bin
	aptitude install libhypre-dev
	aptitude install petsc-dev
	
**Note**: Advanced users may build their own versions of PETSc and an MPI library, `gflow` does not require
any specific preconditioner (we recommend `hypre`) nor does it depend on a particular MPI implementation but it needs PETSc >= 3.7.3
that is available as ready to install/use package on Ubuntu v. 16.10 (but not on 16.04). 

With the required packages installed, `gflow` can be built from its containing folder by running the following terminal command there:

     make

If you encounter errors related to PETSc, you may have to edit the `Makefile` to change the 
value of the `PETSC_DIR` variable. For example, during the above proceedure, aptitude installed petsc here:

	/usr/lib/petscdir/3.7.3/x86_64-linux-gnu-real
	
**Note**: If you receive warnings after `make` but no errors, please try to proceed with using GFlow

Currently, there is no mechanism to automatically copy the `gflow.x` binary to a centrally-located
directory.

### Windows

*Not happening*...


## Running 

*Instructions below apply to Desktop Computers. Advanced use for cluster computing follows a very similar proceedure after dependencies are installed. Details of cluster scheduling/submission scripts are typically unique to given cyberinfrastructure.*

**Easiest using Terminal** 

1. Navigate to the directory where you downloaded GFlow and extract.

2. Extract the zipped example input files (`inputs.tar.gz`) into the current GFlow directory. *E.g., using terminal:*
	```
    tar xvf inputs.tar.gz
	```
3. Open the commented example `execute_example.sh` script with your favorite text editor and examine the format, default settings, and save any necessary
adjustments. Otherwise, the script is ready to submit and solve the example problem.

4. If terminal is not open, open now and navigate to GFlow directory. Execute script:
	```
    sh execute_example.sh
	```
**Note**: You may also need to edit the execute_example.sh file to change the `PETSC_DIR` parameter as done previously for the `Makefile` file
	
5. To stop execution after any iteration, simply open another Terminal window and navigate to the working directory of GFlow. Enter `touch killswitch`. The simulation will cleanly exit after the current calculation and write the existing current density summation.

	1. To print the existing summation of current density without stopping the execution, simply open another Terminal window and navigate to the working directory of GFlow. We need to get the Process ID (PID). Enter:

		```
		ps aux | grep mpiexec
		``` 

	2. Take note of the returned PID value and enter this where your value = PID:

		```
		kill -USR1 PID
		```
